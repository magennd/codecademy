        <h2>A heritage of butchery</h2>

        <p>
          (Northern) Ireland has some delicious fauna. Woodburn butchery club aims to reduce as many of these as fall into our grasp into their
          constituent cuts. In partnership with Knockagh Wild Cooking club, our
          members cook up a storm in the beautiful countryside surrounding
          Carrickfergus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Carrickfergus and its people have a rich history of butchering things,
          and even people! From the town’s earliest celebrity, John de Courcy,
          who killed at least thirteen men with a wooden cross, to later periods
          where meats from a variety of yummy criters (even dogs!) sustained its
          voracious population.

        <h2>Join Us…</h2>
        <p>
          Come along on the second Thursday of every month (but only if that
          Thursday is on an even date, in which case, come along on the third
          Wednesday) for our monthly track and hunt, where we locate and kill
          suitable wild animals. And then again on the following Saturday
          morning, when we will butcher the animals and, alongside the Knockagh
          Wild Cooking Club, roast our kills over an open fire.
        </p>
        <p>It is recommended to bring a packed lunch.</p>
