    <h2>Bloomers historically-inspired undergarments</h2>
    </p>
    <h3>Comfort and support are for the weak!</h3>
    <p>
    <p>
      We at Bloomers believe that modern humans have been cosseted by comfortable and supportive undergarments for too
      long. We design and manufacture historically inspired smallclothes that privilege obscure aesthetic sensibilities
      over comfort and practicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenge yourself today to experience the misery of the past with our range of thought-provoking underwear!

  <h3>A selection of our most popular and least comfortable products.</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <h3>Goatskin Loincloths</h3>
      <p>
        Live authentically paleo (like <a href="https://www.iceman.it/en/">Ötzi the Iceman</a>) with our premium value
        loincloths that tightly bind your nether
        regions in the soft and non-breathable skin of a hardy mountain goat.

  <div class="card">

    <div class="container">
      <h3>Strophiums</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The little-known Strophium brings the wearer back to Antiquity with tightly-bound breasts. Good for sporty
      movements and hard labour, bad for comfort and user satisfaction. Available in a range of non-stretchable fabrics.
    </p>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>Braies</h3>
    <p>
      Live like a Celt with this oversized precursor to the boxer short. So good the Romans adopted them. We've added
      our own twist by making them from burlap! Codpieces can be included upon request.

      <h3>Anton Bloom</h3>
      <p>
        Owner and lead designer of Bloomers, Anton Bloom has never been comfortable with comfort. After discovering the
        unique and deeply unpleasant sensations of scratchy pants during his time at a Georgian Orthodox seminary, Anton
        determined to bring his outmoded tastes in nether-fashion to the masses. He has devoted countless hours to
        studying undesirable underclothes in Moscow's <span class="italic">Muzey Mody</span> and has personally owned
        and worn dozens of items of underwear. This unique and impressive background makes him ideally placed to lead
        his crack team of weavers and seamsters, and to sweep aside the tyranny of decent underwear.

      <h3>Jackie Runner</h3>
      <p>
        Jackie Runner's story is one of devotion to idiosyncratic sartorial choices. She is widely known in her native
        Northern Ireland for her stifling running clothes and scanty formalwear. She brings her singular <span
          class="italic">Weltanschauung</span> to Bloomers.

        Renowned weaving and stitcher sororal duo, Justine and Louisa-Mae labour tirelessly in gruelling working
        conditions to craft the finest gossamer and the coarsest kersey for our undergarments. This dutiful duo work
        like literal dogs, barking and slavering about the place. Whatever their insane behaviour, their product is
        undeniably adequate.

<div class="message">
  <h2>A message from our founder.</h2>
  <p>Studies would show that we spend more time in our underwear than we do in the bath and in the dentist's
    <strong>combined</strong>. I think this is incredible. However, just like the dentist's, no one ever said underwear
    should be comfortable. I'm inspired everyday by how people in the past achieved such elegance even while the world
    around them was miserable. I began to think that our problem in the modern world must be linked. I think it's true
    that, the more uncomfortable your underwear is, the more fulfilling your life will be. Suddenly the dentist's won't
    seem so grim. I love you all.
